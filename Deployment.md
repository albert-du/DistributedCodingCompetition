## Security

**READ ME**

It is in the nature of remote code execution that exploits and zero days will be found, and abused. Thus, employ a zero trust approach to protect user data and the application as a whole. Trust ExecRunner+Piston instances as much as you would trust a turtle to fly. DO NOT. Follow these 10 commands and you might be safe...ish.  

1. DO NOT REUSE EXECRUNNER KEYS

2. DO NOT HOST ANY EXECRUNNER INSTANCES ON THE SAME MACHINE AS ANYTHING ELSE

3. DESTROY ALL VIRTUAL MACHINE INSTANCES WITH THE EXECRUNNER REGULARLY

4. DO NOT AND I MEAN DO NOT, DO NOT ALLOW EXECRUNNER INSTANCES ACCESS TO ANY SECURED VNET, SCREW THAT CREATE A VM IMAGE AND KILL IT FROM THE INTERNET

5. ASSUME THE EXECRUNNERS ARE ALREADY COMPROMISED, HACKED, EXPLOITED, ZERO DAY-eD, COMPLETED ROOTED BY TIME TRAVELING DRUG ENHANCED NAZIS

6. DESTROY THE EXECRUNNERS REGULARLY, THE ENTIRE VIRTUAL MACHINES

7. HELL, DON't EVEN PUT THEM ON THE SAME PHYSICAL MACHINE IF YOU CAN, LET THIRD PARTY VPS SERVICES HANDLE THE RISK

8. IF AN EXECRUNNER STARTS BEING SLOW, OR WEIRD, KILL IT

"The most recent piece of technology I own is a printer ... gun ready to shoot it if it ever makes an unexpected noise"

9. MAKE IT CLEAR TO USERS TO NOT PUT ANY, AND I MEAN ANY, PERSONAL INFORMATION IN

10. I do not take responsibility if you accidentally start the next WannaCry or leak all your users' PII if you mess this up.
